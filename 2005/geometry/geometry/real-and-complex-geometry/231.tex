The best way to go about this problem is to draw a figure of what's happening.

Let $\mathbf{v}$ be the vector representing the plane's travel for an hour and $\mathbf{w}$ be the vector representing the wind offset.

We do not need to provide an exact definition for $\mathbf{v}$, but it is easy to see that $\mathbf{w}=\left[0,-25\right]$.

In figure \vref{231.fig1}, we can see that $\alpha=21^\circ$, as the angles in a triangle add up to $180^\circ$, and we have a $69^\circ$ angle and a $90^\circ$ angle in that triangle. Using the fact that a straight line is $180^\circ$, we have $\beta=180^\circ-21^\circ=150^\circ$.

Figure \vref{231.fig2} shows the triangle in question not drawn to scale to make it easier to read.

We need to find the plane's actual ground speed ($\mathbf{x}$ in the figure).

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\left|\mathbf{x}\right|&=&430^2+25^2-2\left(430\right)\left(25\right)\cos\left(159^\circ\right)\qquad\mbox{(law of cosines)}\\
	&\approx&453.43
\end{eqnarray*}

The magnitude of $\mathbf{x}$ is approximately 453.43, which means that the plane is actually travelling at approximately 453.43 miles per hour.

We can now use the \emph{law of sines} to find the angle at the top of the triangle ($\gamma$ in figure \vref{231.fig2}.

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac{\sin\left(159^\circ\right)}{453.43}&\approx&\frac{\sin\left(\gamma\right)}{25}\\
	\Rightarrow\sin\left(\gamma\right)&\approx&25\frac{\sin\left(159^\circ\right)}{453.43}\\
	\Rightarrow\gamma&\approx&\sin^{-1}\left(25\frac{\sin\left(159^\circ\right)}{453.43}\right)\\
	&\approx&1.13^\circ
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus, the plane's true heading is approximately $\mbox{S}\left(69+1.13\right)^\circ\mbox{E}=\mbox{S}70.13\mbox{E}$.
