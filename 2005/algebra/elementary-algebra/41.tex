    Write and solve an equation to find each amount of money in the
    following:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item An amount of money is increased by $\mbox{\$}6$ is $\mbox{\$}13$.
        \item Two dollars less than an amount of money is $\mbox{\$}17$.
        \item One third of an amount of money is $\mbox{\$}8$.
    \end{enumerate}

In each of these questions, we will use $x$ as a placeholder for the amount of
money we are trying to find.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The equation:

        \[ x + 6 = 13 \]

        The solution:

        \begin{eqnarray*}
                    x + 6 &=& 13\\
            \Rightarrow x &=& 13 - 6\qquad\mbox{(subtract 6 from both sides)}\\
                          &=& 7
        \end{eqnarray*}

        Therefore, $\mbox{\$}7$ is the amount of money that, when increased by
        $\mbox{\$}6$, is $\mbox{\$13}$.

    \item The equation:

        \[ x - 2 = 17 \]

        The solution:

        \begin{eqnarray*}
                    x - 2 &=& 17\\
            \Rightarrow x &=& 19\qquad\mbox{(add 2 to each side)}
        \end{eqnarray*}

        Therefore, $\mbox{\$19}$ is the amount of money which is two dollars
        less than which is $\mbox{\$}17$.

    \item The equation:

        \[ \frac{1}{3}\times x = 8 \]

        The solution:

        \begin{eqnarray*}
              \frac{1}{3}\times x &=& 8\\
            \Rightarrow 1\times x &=& 8\times3\qquad\mbox{(multiply both sides by 3)}\\
                                x &=& 24
        \end{eqnarray*}

        Therefore, $\mbox{\$}24$ is the amount of money of which one third is
        $\mbox{\$}8$.
\end{enumerate}
