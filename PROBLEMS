* QUESTIONS WITH PROBLEMS

168: I couldn't work out what the question was for this post. JDO
219: Wasn't really a question with a straightforward answer. JDO
231: I didn't quite know where to put this, as it deals with vectors, trigonometry, and geometry, so I put it under geometry/geometry/real-and-complex-geometry. JDO
248: This problem wasn't noteworthy enough to be included (seems more like a question of definition than an exercise). JDO
272: I couldn't work out what the series was in (b) or (c), so I left them out. JDO
386: I couldn't work out the question. JDO
415: Not a clear question. JDO
