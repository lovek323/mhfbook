## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ##

    year/part/chapter/section/post-id.tex

year is the four-digit year of the original post

After very little thought, I've decided to change things around again and go with the divisions on the MHF site itself. Descriptions for chapters, etc. are also taken from Wikipedia. At the moment, we'll only be dividing into three levels, but sub-section might come into it if necessary.

The idea is that if it's in the calculus sub-forum, it's probably calculus. If something's obviously not or you can't justify its inclusion in that section, place it in the most appropriate section.

post-id is the original post id on the mathhelpforum.com web site


## SOFTWARE REQURIED ##

git (you'll probably want to use git-gui as well)
latex and associated packages (uses times, url, amssymb, graphicx, varioref, geometry, framed, color, iwona, sectsty, cclicenses, multienum, cancel and makeidx)
asymptote
dvipdfm
makeindex

So far, I haven't been able to find a DVI viewer that is able to correctly display the cclicenses glyphs.


## DOWNLOADING A SNAPSHOT ##

You can download a snapshot from the github web site: http://github.com/lovek323/mhfbook


## COMPILING ##

In one of the year subdirectories (e.g., 2005), execute

./build.sh

This will create a book-name.dvi (e.g., 2005.dvi) file, which you can view in your favourite dvi viewer (e.g., xdvi).


## GIT EXCLUDE ##

It will save you a lot of time (and the rest of us a headache) if you add these files to your the git exclude file (./git/info/exclude):

*.eps
*.aux
*.log
*.dvi
*.pdf
*.toc
*.idx
*.ilg
*.ind

If you use vim and don't store your temporary files in a special place (why?), add this

*.swp


## PLEASE ##

Do not commit compiled files (eps, pdf, dvi, etc.). Only commit the source files. Anyone with a properly set-up system will be able to compile the files and we'll release compiled versions at appropriate milestones.

Give good commit messages if you can be bothered.

Don't forget to push your changes to the master branch if you're happy with them.

Don't forget to set your global git variables

git config --global user.name "your name"
git config --global user.email "your e-mail address"


## PROBLEMS ##

If there's a question you're excluding for a good reason, add it to the PROBLEMS file.
