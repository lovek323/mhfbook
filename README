## SOFTWARE REQURIED ##

git
latex and associated packages (uses times, url, amssymb, graphicx, varioref, and geometry)
asymptote


## GIT EXCLUDE ##

It will save you a lot of time (and the rest of us a headache) if you add these files to your the git exclude file (./git/info/exclude):

*.aux
*.dvi
*.log
*.eps

If you use vim and don't store your temporary files in a special place (why?), add this

*.swp


## PLEASE ##

Do not commit compiled files (eps, pdf, dvi, etc.). Only commit the source files. Anyone with a properly set-up system will be able to compile the files and we'll release compiled versions at appropriate milestones.

Give good commit messages if you can be bothered.
