## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ##

year/category/sub-category/post-id.tex

year is the four-digit year of the original post
category is the forum (or sub-forum) of the post
sub-category is a name that seemed to make sense
post-id is the original post id on the mathhelpforum.com web site


## SOFTWARE REQURIED ##

git
latex and associated packages (uses times, url, amssymb, graphicx, varioref, and geometry)
asymptote


## DOWNLOADING A SNAPSHOT ##

You can download a snapshot from the github web site: http://github.com/lovek323/mhfbook


## COMPILING ##

In one of the year subdirectories (e.g., 2005), execute

./build.sh

This will create a book-name.dvi (e.g., 2005.dvi) file, which you can view in your favourite dvi viewer (e.g., xdvi).


## GIT EXCLUDE ##

It will save you a lot of time (and the rest of us a headache) if you add these files to your the git exclude file (./git/info/exclude):

*.aux
*.dvi
*.log
*.eps

If you use vim and don't store your temporary files in a special place (why?), add this

*.swp


## PLEASE ##

Do not commit compiled files (eps, pdf, dvi, etc.). Only commit the source files. Anyone with a properly set-up system will be able to compile the files and we'll release compiled versions at appropriate milestones.

Give good commit messages if you can be bothered.
