## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ##

    year/part/chapter/section/post-id.tex

year is the four-digit year of the original post

part is one of `foundations', `algebra', `geometry', or `analysis' (from http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/beginners.html)
chapter is the subdivision of the part (from http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/beginners.html) which seemed to fit best
section is the subdivision of the chapter (from http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/beginners.html) which seemed to fit best
at the moment, we'll only be dividing into three levels, but sub-section might come into it if necessary

post-id is the original post id on the mathhelpforum.com web site


## SOFTWARE REQURIED ##

git (you'll probably want to use git-gui as well)
latex and associated packages (uses times, url, amssymb, graphicx, varioref, geometry, framed, color, iwona, and sectsty)
asymptote
dvipdfm


## DOWNLOADING A SNAPSHOT ##

You can download a snapshot from the github web site: http://github.com/lovek323/mhfbook


## COMPILING ##

In one of the year subdirectories (e.g., 2005), execute

./build.sh

This will create a book-name.dvi (e.g., 2005.dvi) file, which you can view in your favourite dvi viewer (e.g., xdvi).


## GIT EXCLUDE ##

It will save you a lot of time (and the rest of us a headache) if you add these files to your the git exclude file (./git/info/exclude):

*.eps
*.aux
*.log
*.dvi
*.pdf
*.toc

If you use vim and don't store your temporary files in a special place (why?), add this

*.swp


## PLEASE ##

Do not commit compiled files (eps, pdf, dvi, etc.). Only commit the source files. Anyone with a properly set-up system will be able to compile the files and we'll release compiled versions at appropriate milestones.

Give good commit messages if you can be bothered.

Don't forget to push your changes to the master branch if you're happy with them.

Don't forget to set your global git variables

git config --global user.name "your name"
git config --global user.email "your e-mail address"


## PROBLEMS ##

If there's a question you're excluding for a good reason, add it to the PROBLEMS file.
